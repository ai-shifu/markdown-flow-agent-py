"""Backslash escapes for the delimiters inside an interaction's brackets.

`?[A|B]` gives `|`, `//`, `...` and `]` structural meaning, so option text that contains one of
them is reshaped: a bar splits one choice into two, a double slash gives half the display away to
the stored value, an ellipsis turns the rest into a text box, and a bracket ends the interaction
early. An option carrying a URL or a regular expression could not be written at all.

A backslash before one of those characters now makes it ordinary text.

The escape is deliberately *selective*: a backslash is an escape only when the character after it
is a delimiter, and is literal text everywhere else. `\\\\` is not an escape either. That matters
for content that already exists: of 110,685 interactions in published courses, 97 contain a
backslash and every one of them is LaTeX -- `$\\pi_\\theta$`, `\\beta`, `\\nabla`, and `\\\\` as a
line break. A general "backslash escapes the next character" rule would render those as
`$pi_theta$`. Under this rule, none of them change.

The cost is that a literal backslash cannot sit immediately before a literal delimiter: `\\|` is
an escaped bar, not a backslash and a separator. Nothing in the measured corpus writes that.
